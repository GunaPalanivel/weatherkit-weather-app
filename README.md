# Programmatic-UI-Weather-App
# An iOS weather app with a programmatic user interface (no storyboard)

This is my first complete app, development is now closd on this specific verion that uses a simple openweathermap API because of the migration 
to WeatherKit which has much more information available (and is included with an Apple Developer Account!!!!)

It's completely made without storyboards and is very adaptive to all different sizes of screens (it looks a bit worse on iPad but hey, it's fine)
Feel free to use any part of the code, no attribution or mentioning required (but it is appreciated)
Hope that it was useful and won't get burried in the pile of 0 star github repos
